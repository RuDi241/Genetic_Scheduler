# Problem:
There are M machines, and N parts that should undergo processing on a number of machines for a set amount of time in a specified order. A machine can process only one part at time. The goal is to minimize the time required for processing.
# Solution:
A genetic algorithm that makes gradual changes to the schedule and then evaluates the effect of these changes on the total time. Thus, gradually decreasing the time required for processing the parts. For a full description check the pdf file in the repository.
# Test Cases:
There are a few examples of generated folders in the test_cases directory.
